# 📱 MAD Lab Experiment 02 – Android Activity Lifecycle

An Android application developed using **Kotlin** to demonstrate the **Android Activity Lifecycle**. This experiment displays the lifecycle callbacks (`onCreate()`, `onStart()`, `onResume()`, `onPause()`, `onStop()`, `onRestart()`, and `onDestroy()`) using **Toast messages** and **Logcat**, helping understand how an Activity behaves during different user interactions.

---

# 📖 About the Project

The Android Activity Lifecycle defines how an activity is created, started, resumed, paused, stopped, restarted, and destroyed.

This application demonstrates every lifecycle method by displaying a Toast message and writing logs whenever the activity changes its state.

The project is developed as **Experiment 2** for the **Mobile Application Development (MAD) Laboratory**.

# ▶️ How to Test the Lifecycle

Perform the following actions and observe the lifecycle methods:

- Launch the app
- Press the Home button
- Return to the app
- Rotate the device
- Press the Back button
- Open another application

Observe the Toast messages and Logcat output corresponding to each lifecycle callback.
